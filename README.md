### üóÇÔ∏è Please Note 

This revisited project is **verifiable via university of north texas canvas submission archive** but does not include the raw code files due to access to the undergrad VM system being no longer valid at this time. The included slide content was a summaritive aspect of the project that was to be the final submission, alongside a since passed clasroom presentation.
